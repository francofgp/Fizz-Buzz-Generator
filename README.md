Using the [.NET CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet) to run the project.

```bash

and if you want to make your own .exe single file, you will need:

```bash
dotnet publish -r win-x64 /p:PublishSingleFile=true /p:IncludeNativeLibrariesForSelfExtract=false /p:SelfContained=false --output "C:\Users\PC\Desktop"
